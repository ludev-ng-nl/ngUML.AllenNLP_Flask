Current process - Building the conditional paths

if we have a condition
    create conditional node
    prev_node = conditional node
    guard = condition text
    conditional_start_node = prev_node

if there is only one
    create a merge node and close the process

go through all conditional resolt
    if sentence == condition
        create guard and set previous type to decision.
    elif prev_type = decision
        create action 
        prev_node = action
        prev_type = 'action'
        merge_nodes append(action)
    else
        create action
        remove old last action and add Current

Currently we get all based on conditional or action tag
or in the same coref cluster.

need to check if the previous action or condition has 
something todo with the one before. If so we couple otherwise
we end the creation of this conditional process.
